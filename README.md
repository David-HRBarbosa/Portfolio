Welcome to my personal web developer portfolio! This project showcases my journey into web development and includes several of my frontend and backend projects built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm David Henrique, a 25-year-old web developer currently transitioning from painting to the tech industry.

Originally from Brazil and currently living in Portugal for over a year and a half, I immigrated to provide a better life for my family back home. Along this journey, I’ve been deeply focused on building a new career that truly excites me — software development.

I hold a certification in Web Programming from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS), where I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, programming logic, databases, and web systems design.

I'm currently expanding my backend skills through DevClub, learning technologies such as Node.js and TypeScript.
